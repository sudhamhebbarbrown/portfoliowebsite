Here's a summary of my education so far.

## Brown University

<Small>Masters of Science in Computer Science, 2023 - 2025</Small>
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Brown University, with a GPA of 3.9/4.0, and am expected to graduate in May 2025. My coursework has provided me with deep knowledge in areas such as Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, Systems Changing Systems (research-focused), and Database Management. As a teaching assistant, I have further developed my technical and leadership skills by guiding students and assisting in course delivery, reinforcing my understanding of complex computer science concepts while contributing to the academic growth of my peers.
I am currently researching on combined static and dynamic analysis to prevent supply chain attacks in npm packages and I am expecting to publish my research in the upcoming year.

## Ramaiah Institute of Technology

<Small>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 2017 - 2021</Small>
I completed my B.E. in Information Science and Engineering from MSRIT (VTU) in Bengaluru, graduating with a perfect 4.0/4.0 GPA in July 2021. My coursework included key subjects such as Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, and Data Structures and Algorithms, which provided a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. This experience honed my problem-solving skills and fueled my passion for technology and innovation.
