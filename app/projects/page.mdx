Here's a summary of my education so far.

## Distributed Search engine

<Small>Brown University (1370)</Small>
I built a distributed computing system from the ground up, taking it from the initial setup all the way to cloud deployment on AWS. The focus was on creating a scalable, fault-tolerant architecture, and I also developed a custom serialization/deserialization system to make data exchange between nodes more efficient and reliable. I implemented things like an actor framework, an RPC system, and gossip protocols to keep everything running smoothly and responsive. For data processing, I set up map and reduce functions using shell scripts for real-time streaming. Finally, I put the system to the test with 10,000 concurrent users using Apache JMeter to make sure it could handle the load.


## DinoDB

<Small>Brown University (1270)</Small>
I built a database called Dino DB from scratch, where I implemented features like paging, hashing, querying, B+ trees, joins, concurrency control, and recoveryâ€”all in Go. It was a great way to dive deep into database internals and understand how everything works under the hood. Every since then I have taken a deepdive into Postgres and it's distributed nature.


## Music streaming service

<Small>Brown University (1270)</Small>
Curious about real-time streaming services like twitch and spotify, I developed a music streaming platform using Django, Next.js, and PostgreSQL that allows users to create playlists, like tracks, and stream music. I integrated secure user authentication with Auth0 and JWT tokens to manage logins and sessions. For handling the audio, I used AWS S3 for storage and streaming, ensuring smooth and efficient media delivery. I also set up real-time tracking of streams and likes using PostgreSQL, making sure the data stays accurate and scalable.
